# Media-Board
In the online mode of teaching, it is very difficult for the teachers to adapt to a myriad of platforms and ever-changing digital tools in their delivery of new content. Media-Board is very simple and convenient to use thus making it very simple for the teachers to record their videos, explain concepts on the whiteboard and also save their work in the browser itself. We can add slide, remove slide, change slide ordering, download slide, download all the sides in a pdf format, use the whiteboard to draw, upload image, add sticky note, turn the camera on/off, record video with screen-sharing, computer-audio and microphone audio and save it to the browser gallery from where we can download to our local machine and can also delete it from the browser gallery. Thus making it super simple to save our work. Even when we visit the page back, the slides won't delete. They will be saved in our local storage. The gallery items will be saved in our IndexedDB.
